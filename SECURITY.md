# Security Policy - Ollama Phone Chat

## Security Philosophy
Ollama Phone Chat is built on a "Local-First" architecture. By default, it operates over your Local Area Network (LAN). While this provides a layer of physical security, users should be aware of the security considerations when using and potentially exposing this service.

## Security Features

### 1. HTML Sanitization
We use [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/dompurify) on the frontend to sanitize all Markdown output before it is rendered. This prevents Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks from malicious or malformed model responses.

### 2. SQL Injection Prevention
All interactions with the SQLite database use **parameterized queries** via the `sqlite3` driver. This ensures that user input cannot be used to manipulate database queries.

### 3. Static File Isolation
The Express server is configured to serve static assets only from the `public/` directory, preventing directory traversal attacks.

## Security Recommendations

### LAN Security
Since the application runs over HTTP on your LAN, anyone on the same Wi-Fi could potentially access the bridge if they know the IP and port. We recommend:
-   Running the server only on trusted networks.
-   Stopping the server when not in use.

### Remote Access (Public Internet)
If you choose to expose Ollama Phone Chat to the public internet (e.g., via NGROK, Cloudflare Tunnels, or Port Forwarding), you **MUST**:
1.  **Use HTTPS**: Ensure the connection is encrypted.
2.  **Implement Authentication**: The current version does not include built-in user authentication. Use a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Caddy) to add Basic Auth or OIDC if exposing to the web.
3.  **Secure your `.env`**: Never commit your `.env` file containing API keys to public repositories.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please **do not open a public issue**. Instead, report it privately to the maintainer:

-   **Lead Maintainer**: Krishna Kanth B
-   **GitHub**: [@krishnakanthb13](https://github.com/krishnakanthb13)

We aim to respond to security reports within 48 hours and provide a fix or mitigation strategy within 7 days.

## Warning: LLM Hallucinations
Please remember that the responses generated by the models are provided by your local Ollama instance. Ollama Phone Chat is a bridge and does not control the content or safety of the model's output. Use "thinking" models or system prompts to guide model behavior safely.
